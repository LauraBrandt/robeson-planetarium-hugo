Please note that the dates of August 20, 21, and 22 are going to be very dense traffic days on the I-95 corridor, as many thousands of people will be heading down to South Carolina from points North to view the total solar eclipse of Monday August 21.

\
Here in Lumberton, we will see about 98% of the Sun covered by the moon, with maximum partial eclipse occurring at 2:42 pm.

\
Expect greater than holiday levels of traffic along the I 95 corridor, especially on the evening of Monday August 21, as folks are headed home from the total event in central South Carolina. This should be a great opportunity for area hotels and restaurants, as many folks will be looking for rest and refreshment after extremely heavy traffic going to and coming from this once-in-a-lifetime event.
